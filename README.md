# CPU-BURST-TIME-PREDICTION 


In older days, uniprocessor system handles the execution of single process at a time. In current, we need to run multiple process within time entitled as ‘Multi processing’. The requirement for scheduling emerges from the prerequisite of multiprocessing that helps to choose which process among queue would be allotted to CPU for execution. Thus, we use different scheduling algorithm named as First Come First Serve, Round Robin, Shortest Job First and Priority for scheduling out in different means. Shortest Job First (SJF) is not virtually implemented due to the fact that operating system doesn’t know the execution time termed as burst period of a process before. Numerous methods such as exponential averaging, simple averaging method exists for predicting the burst time hypothetically. Thus, aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the burst time of a process in factual. A Hybrid SJF algorithm is implemented and matched its performance with other algorithms stated and witnessed that the newly proposed hybrid algorithm indicates enhanced performance
